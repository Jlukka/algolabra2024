# Project specification

- I will be writing the program in python
- Other languages than python I can somewhat read js and java
- I'll be implementing RSA encryption
- The program will take files as input and have some way of accessing different public and private keys for different entities
- I'm in the Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti programme
- I'm intending to use english for all documentation during the course



## Core of the project

- Core is the encryption and decryption of inputs with the RSA algorithm.
