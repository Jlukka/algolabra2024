# week 5
- this week i finished rest of the necessary things for the algorithm to actually work
- learned or maybe was reminded of a bunch of stuff i didnt really know what their real life uses were, lowest common multiple and greatest common divisor
- documentation and testing is still absolutely non-existent so those will be the things i start working on next
- modular exponentiation is also currently being done with a built in method, will replace it next week aswell.
questions
- what sort of testing is enough for the prime generation, how can i check that they are actually prime?
- what about testing the algorithm itself, testing whether it decrypts encrypted messages is fairly obvious but how do i test the encryption side?
